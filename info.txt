buy less: 
We often buy WAY too much food. We can't eat all of it before it goes bad. Buy less than you think you need. You'll typically wind up with the right amount. 
You can always stop by the store to pick up a couple of things if you need more, but you can't reverse the aging greens in your crisper drawer.
