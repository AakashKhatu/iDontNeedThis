buy less: 
We often buy WAY too much food. We can't eat all of it before it goes bad. Buy less than you think you need. You'll typically wind up with the right amount. 
You can always stop by the store to pick up a couple of things if you need more, but you can't reverse the aging greens in your crisper drawer.
Don�t shop hungry, it makes you buy more.
Writing down what you came for and ignore everything that�s not on your list. This will save you money. It will also save time and fuel expense by preventing repeat trips to the store for things you forgot. 

save paper:

Increase use of E-Books , E-Newspaper. Promote emailing and sharing the documents in the soft copy form.
Highly fancy and thick wedding cards are purely waste of money and paper . They also contribute in polluting the water bodies as most of the cards are being thrown in water bodies . So the wedding cards should be in the Electronic form or  should be of basic kind which use the minimum paper .


Reducing E-waste
Just because a device is older doesn't mean it's worthless. Ask an expert for a cost-benefit analysis for repairing or upgrading old gear.
Old computers don't necessarily have a lot of value to many people, although you can check eBay and other sites that allow individuals and companies to sell used products. It may be that what no longer has worth to you might be helpful to someone else.
Another possibility is to donate electronics.
The final option is to recycle products. Depending on the volume, you might be able to use free services offered by manufacturers and specialty retailers, or use commercial services that can handle bulk recycling.
